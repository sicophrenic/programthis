# Program This (Work in Progress)

This repository hosts all of my solutions to the challenges posted to [programthis](http://programthis.net).

## SOLUTIONS

Solutions are located at nested folders under challenge names. For example, solutions available to a challenge would be available at: "[ChallengeName]/sic/". Solutions are generally available in three languages: Python, Java, and C. Completed solutions: { hail-caesar, polynomial, vigenere }

## Project Details

I chose to develop solutions for the challenges at [programthis.net](http://programthis.net) for two main reasons. Firstly, the challenges provide a great opportunity for me to brush up on my programming skills in any of the languages I prefer to write in. Secondly, the specific focuses of each of the challenges allow me to also refresh my knowledge on various topics of computer science, from string and pointer manipulation to simple mathematical algorithms. The wide variety of available challenges and the possibility of solutions in different languages make it easy to stay up-to-date on my programming skills, which is why I took it upon myself to take part in composing my own solutions to these problems.

I am proud of my current contributions to the project primarily because this was one of the first assignments I took on myself to not just learn more about programming and computer science topics and tools such as Git management and the third-party tool CodeRunner to test various code snippets and helper functions but also gradually refresh and build up my skills as a young programmer.
